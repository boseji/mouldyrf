# MouldyRF - It's for RF Prototyping, not for fungus.

Some FAQ:

###What the hell is this?

In 2013 I designed this board for my own use when testing various RF parts. I had plans to sell them, but it's a lot of work and as of 2016 have had zero time for this. Instead it's now an open-source project.

###What parts does it fit?

It can shittily fit most parts. I've used this board with SOT-23, SOT-363, SOT-343, SOT-89, 4-pin plastic, SOIC-8, 0603, 0805, and 1206 parts.

###Can I sell them in my webstore?

The license is officially CC BY-SA, as I didn't want to deal with the hassles of a special license. But I do ask that if you offer them in your webstore, you add a $0.15 US/EUR (or approximate it local currancy) surcharge and donate this to your local SPCA per board sold. If you make a big donation please let me know as it will make me happy.

###Your RF design sucks.

The multi-package area near the microstrip screws up a lot of stuff, but it was more than good enough for what I'm doing. I immediately quit trying once it vaguely worked.
